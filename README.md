# Audiofy
Music and literature have always been the best art forms to deliver one’s thoughts and emotions. Audiofy uses literature and music parallelly i.e. it generates music based on the emotions conveyed by the literature. The application best assists readers for an enhanced reading experience. The work specifically focuses on novels and generates music that captures the change in the distribution of emotion words. 
This entire process can be segregated into 3 phases:-
- Text recognition using Optical Character Recognition
- Sentimental Analysis of the captured text
- Audio Retrieval/Generation based on retrieved emotion from literature
Each of these phases is handled separately with the best possible technique to yield maximum accuracy.
